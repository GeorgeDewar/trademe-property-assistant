TradeMe Property Assistant
==========================

A Chrome extension to inject travel time to work and rating information into TradeMe property listings.

TradeMe Property Assistant supplements property listings with useful information that can help you easily make a more informed decision about whether you're interested.

You can configure where you work and when you work, and it will add a section to property listings showing how long the commute will be, using Google Directions.

For example, you might say that you work at 123 Cuba St, Wellington, and want to arrive at 9am on a Monday by public
transport. TravelTime will then give you the timing for a public transport journey from the house you are looking at
to your workplace, arriving at 9am the following Monday (it generally wouldn't matter which weekday you choose, but
you might work on a Saturday or Sunday which may have a different timetable).

It will also gather rating information (Wellington only, but more cities to come), so that if the seller doesn't provide details like the RV, floor area, land area, building age, etc, TradeMe Property Assistant will provide those for you - and if they do, it will verify them independently.

When you install TradeMe Property Assistant, head to the Options page first to enter in your workplace details.
