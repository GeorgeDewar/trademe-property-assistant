traveltime
==========

A Chrome extension to inject travel time to work into TradeMe property listings

It allows you to configure where you work, your mode of transport, and (for public transport) when you want to leave 
or arrive.

For example, you might say that you work at 123 Cuba St, Wellington, and want to arrive at 9am on a Monday by public
transport. TravelTime will then give you the timing for a public transport journey from the house you are looking at
to your workplace, arriving at 9am the following Monday (it generally wouldn't matter which weekday you choose, but
you might work on a Saturday or Sunday which may have a different timetable).
